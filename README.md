    <h1>svelte-document</h1>
<p>

Create documents, resumes, or presentations from a collection of Svelte files. No configuration needed, and exports to a very portable PDF file.

## Usage
### Getting started
Install `svelte-document` from `npm` as a global package, then invoke it in any directory containing `.svelte` pages that you want formatted into a PDF. A file called `document.pdf` will be generated in the current working directory.

```sh
# Install the package globally
npm install -g svelte-document

# Invoke the command
svelte-document
```

### Page semantics and ordering
To order your pages is to simply number them: `1.svelte`, `2.svelte`, `3.svelte`, and so on. The order which your filesystem presents the files do not impact the order in the document. You can also title your page by inserting any contents after a space character, like so: `5 How to Install Linux.svelte`.

You can also use periods in your number to create subsections if needed, such as in `5.1 Troubleshooting.svelte`.

Folders are not parsed, so you can use them to store components and assets, and files starting with `+` are ignored, save for `+layout.svelte` (explained later).

### Page metadata in components
You can export the following Svelte variables in a `<script>...</script>` block and they will be automatically filled in by the tool:

| Variable name | Description |
|-|-|
| `page_name` | The name of the page provided after the page index in your file name. If there is no name, this value will be empty (`""`). |
| `page_path` | The full path to the current page component. |
| `page_index` | The page index from the file name. This is a string. |
| `page_count` | The number of the page, starting from 1. This is an integer. |

### Importing assets
#### Images
You can import images directly like so:
```svelte
<script>
    import img from "./my-image.png"
</script>

<img src={img} />
```

#### Fonts
Fonts can also be imported. The file name of the font can be used in `font-family` styling, like so:
```svelte
<script>
    import "./FontFile.ttf"
</script>

<div style="font-family: FontFile;">Hello world!</div>
```

### Layout
You can provide a `+layout.svelte` file that will wrap every page. Its functionality is the same as [SvelteKit's `+layout.svelte`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#layout).
>[!TIP]
>Layout files can import CSS stylesheets using import statements, like so: `import "./styles.css"`. Other pages cannot import CSS stylesheets, but can use `<style>...</style>` blocks.

## Configuration
`svelte-document` is zero configuration, but you can provide optional configuration in a `document.config.json` file in the root of your document files, with the following fields:
| Field | Default | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `size` | `A4` | Dimensions of the page. Accepted values: `A5`, `A4`, `A3`, `B5`, `B4`, `JIS-B5`, `JIS-B4`, `letter`, `legal`, `ledger`, or a set of custom dimensions with the following format: `{number}in/cm/mm {number}in/cm/mm`, such as `24in 24in` or `300mm 300mm`. |
| `orientation` | `portrait` | Orientation of the page. Accepted values: `portrait`, `landscape` |
| `out` | `document.pdf` | Output file path/name, relative to the current working directory. |

## Roadmap
- [ ] Better compatibility with projects using Node packages.
- [ ] Transition to Vite.  
  - Currently, each individual `.svelte` file is compiled using `svelte/compiler` and some transformations are executed with `esbuild` (e.g., for import statements). However, I want to look into using Vite instead as it has a broader ecosystem and would resolve some ongoing issues.
